class Screen:
    """Canvas class for terminal drawing.

    This is the main class on Terminedia library - methods and associated instances here
    should be used to do all screen rendering and drawing save for low-level work.

    Use this as a context manager inside which the screen is active;

    For drawing primitives using full-block chars, use the instance's
    :any:`Screen.draw`, which contains a :any:`Drawing` instance. Terminal context colors
    and other attributes can be set in a thread-safe way on the
    ``screen.context`` namespace.

    To draw and position characters using 1/4 character high resolution,
    use the attributes and methods available at :any:`Screen.high`.
    (High resolution drawing methods are available at ``screen.high.draw``)

    Besides the available methods and associated instances, screen contents
    can be set and read by using the Screen instance as a 2-dimensional mapping.
    For example, ``screen[10, 10] = "A"`` will set the character on that position.

    Args:
      - size (optional 2-sequence): Screen size in blocks. If not given, terminal size is queried automatically.
        This does not resize the actual terminal - a smaller area is available to the methods instead.
        If given size is larger than the actual terminal, mayhen ensues.
      - clear_screen (bool): Whether to clear the terminal and hide cursor when entering the screen. Defaults to True.
